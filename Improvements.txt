1) A robust predicition  model can be developed that will help understanding vegetation cover
  at any future time and date.
2) Fast interface providing and suggesting the health of particular region with additional
features like altitude , wind , microbe heatlh, etc
3) testing various models to analyse the best model possible for prediction.
